# Thoughts and Reflections on project

If this was a full project I would potentially do the following, that was not included in the brief

- Align the UI and visuals to be more in alignment with CareMasters Support Worker Management UI (the assumption is that there would be a designer doing slices in Figma). Currently the layout is acceptable, with clear delineations between visual states and layouts. However, I would liked to have made it more aesthetically pleasing
- While not stated in the brief, I would have added an option in the Client Picker to create a new client if one was not found. For the purposes of this brief, I simply created a bunch of default values and stored them in the clients.json file.
- Addition of Filter and Sort options. Filter options should include by Client -> Client Value, Category -> Category Value. Sort options by both of those value types (including adding a sort by Date)
- With the context that CareMaster is an NDIS Support organisation, I would add functionality such as priority setting for notes, a client inspector to overview all notes and list dates of note taking
